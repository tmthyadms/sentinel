# Sentinel ðŸš§
An online assessment website to proctor students using neural network.

## Main Features
There are three main features, which are as follows:
<dl>
  <dt>Face Detection</dt>
  <dd>For verifying that students are consistently facing their screens.</dd>
  <dt>Event Log</dt>
  <dd>For maintaining the records of all students actions and interactions during the assessment.</dd>
  <dt>Restroom Breaks</dt>
  <dd>For allowing students to take up to two 5-minutes breaks.</dd>
</dl>

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
[face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api,js) is used to automate student proctoring. The settings are as follows:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Face Detection Model</th>
    <td align="center">Tiny Face Detector</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Face Landmark</th>
    <td align="center">Available</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Confidence Threshold</th>
    <td align="center">0.60</td>
  </tr>
</table>
