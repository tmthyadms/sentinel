# Sentinel
Sentinel is a straightforward online exam website that uses AI (artificial intelligence) to keep exams fair and secure. It has three main features:

1. Face Detection: It checks if students are facing the screen during the exam.

2. Activity Log: It keeps a record of when students are not facing the screen or take restroom breaks, including their names, IDs, and the time of the incident.

3. Restroom Breaks: Students can take restroom breaks, but they are limited to two breaks, and each break can only last for 5 minutes.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including the [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) library) and uses the Fetch API to update the database.
